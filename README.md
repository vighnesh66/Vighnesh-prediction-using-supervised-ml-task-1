First we extract libraries for the given relatable datas for successfull completing the project.
secondly we import datas from online and read it and analyze it fully.
input the given data and vizulaize it through plotting it.
we next prepare the data sets and train the algorithm.
Then we plot the regression using graph.
finally we predict and evaluate the model.
